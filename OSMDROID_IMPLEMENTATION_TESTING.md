# OSMDroid Implementation Testing Guide

## Overview
The map loading issue in AddHabitActivity has been fixed by replacing the WebView-based implementation with OSMDroid (native Android OpenStreetMap library).

## What Was Fixed
1. **Problem**: WebView with Leaflet.js was failing to load external map tiles, showing only current location and blank page
2. **Solution**: Replaced with OSMDroid native Android library for better performance and reliability

## Implementation Changes

### Dependencies Added
- `org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.18` in `build.gradle.kts`

### Permissions Added (AndroidManifest.xml)
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - For OSMDroid tile caching
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - For OSMDroid tile caching

### Layout Changes (embedded_map_view.xml)
- Replaced `WebView (map_web_view)` with `MapView (osm_map_view)`
- Added control buttons:
  - `btn_current_location` - Go to current location
  - `btn_clear_selection` - Clear selected location
  - `selected_location_text` - Display selected coordinates/address

### Code Changes (AddHabitActivity.java)
- Removed WebView, WebViewClient, and JavaScript interface code
- Added OSMDroid imports and configuration
- Implemented native map click handling with coordinate conversion
- Added marker placement and management
- Integrated current location functionality with permission checking
- Added clear selection functionality
- Implemented background geocoding for address resolution
- Added proper OSMDroid lifecycle management and cleanup
- Removed the entire `getMapHtml()` method (300+ lines of HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Launch the App
- Open Shedulytic app on your Android device
- Navigate to "Add Habit" functionality

### 2. Test Location Selection
- Tap on the location selection option
- The embedded map should now display:
  - ✅ Proper OpenStreetMap tiles loading (instead of blank page)
  - ✅ Current location marker (blue dot)
  - ✅ Control buttons at the bottom

### 3. Test Map Interactions
- **Tap on Map**: Should place a red marker at tapped location
- **Current Location Button**: Should center map on your current location
- **Clear Selection Button**: Should remove the selected location marker
- **Selected Location Text**: Should display coordinates and address of selected location

### 4. Test Location Integration
- Select a location on the map
- Save/confirm the location
- Verify it integrates properly with habit creation workflow

### 5. Test Edge Cases
- **No GPS/Location Permission**: Should handle gracefully
- **No Internet Connection**: Should still show cached tiles
- **Background/Foreground**: Should properly pause/resume map

## Expected Improvements
1. **Performance**: Native Android implementation is faster than WebView
2. **Reliability**: No dependency on external CDNs or network for basic functionality
3. **Offline Support**: OSMDroid caches tiles for offline viewing
4. **Battery Life**: More efficient than WebView implementation
5. **User Experience**: Smoother interactions and faster loading

## Troubleshooting

### If Map Still Doesn't Load
1. Check internet connection for initial tile download
2. Verify location permissions are granted
3. Check if device has sufficient storage for tile caching

### If Location Selection Doesn't Work
1. Ensure location permissions are granted
2. Check if GPS is enabled on device
3. Try tapping different areas of the map

### Build Issues
1. Clean and rebuild project: `./gradlew clean build`
2. Check that OSMDroid dependency is properly added
3. Verify all required permissions are in AndroidManifest.xml

## Technical Details
- **OSMDroid Version**: 6.1.18
- **Map Provider**: OpenStreetMap
- **Tile Source**: Mapnik (default)
- **Caching**: Local tile cache enabled
- **Permissions**: Storage permissions for caching
- **Threading**: Background geocoding for address resolution
